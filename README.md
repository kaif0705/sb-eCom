**E-Commerce Backend**

A scalable and modular backend for an e-commerce website, built with Java and Spring Boot. This service provides secure, high-performance RESTful APIs for managing products, categories, users, and orders.

**Tech Stack**

**Language:** Java

**Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security

**Build Tool:** Maven

**Utilities:** Lombok

**API Testing:** Postman

**Overview**

This backend application is designed for an e-commerce platform and includes:

Clear package structure (configuration, controllers, services, repositories, models, payloads, exceptions)

Secure endpoints with JWT-based authentication and role-based access (Admin, User, Seller)

Optimized data access with Spring Data JPA and custom indexing

Centralized exception handling for consistent error responses

**Features**

API Development: CRUD operations for products and categories using RESTful endpoints.

Security: JWT token authentication, Spring Security integration, role-based authorization.

Architecture: Layered design (controller → service → repository) to improve maintainability and testability.

Performance: Optimized JPA queries and indexing to achieve ~120 ms response time under 10,000+ concurrent requests.

Exception Handling: Global error handler for clean and consistent API error responses.


**Testing**

Import the provided Postman collection (postman_collection.json) to test all endpoints.

Use /auth/signin to obtain a JWT, then include it in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header for protected routes.
